## Getting started

There are detailed instructions at the Jekyll link above, but if you are on a mac and already familiar with .git, you may be able to:

1. open Terminal
1. check out this repo
1. `cd` into the new folder
1. run `bundle exec jekyll serve`
1. open your browser to `http://127.0.0.1:4000`

Your browser should show a local copy the site, and you can make changes in that folder that will automatically show up there. When you are ready to push those changes to the live site, you'll need to commit your work and create a pull request in any of the usual ways. (The GitHub command line utility is one way.)

See the github "Issues" for a list of things to work on, or create a new issue to start a discussion!
