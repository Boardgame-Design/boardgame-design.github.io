## Event descriptions

### Design Day

Please see the page for [Design Days](days).


### Game Day

Design Days hosts the occasional *Game Day* event.

> The intent of this event is to have fun and play some games so feel free to bring whatever games you want and whatever people you want! I plan to bring some of my deckbuilders I haven't played enough, but will absolutely be down to join whatever games are happening. I will still do my best to do my typical group-matching/timing dealio, but it may be more difficult since we probably want to play all these games to completion.

### Iron Designer Challenge

> Iron Designer Challenge is a series of activities in which designers compete to be deemed the Iron Designer/s for the year (which is mostly bragging rights). You can enter as either solo or pairs. Imagine Chopped or Forged in Fire but for tabletop games. It's a great time and it only requires you to bring yourself! All components and materials are provided.
