# About this site

This site was conceived and started by [Martin Grider](http://martingrider.name/), but its intent is for it to be a community resource, and as such, you can find all its code and contents [on GitHub](https://github.com/Boardgame-Design/boardgame-design.github.io).

The inspiration and initial calendar of events came from Trevor Muller-Hegel of Split Perspective Studios (who also hosts Design Day).

## How to help

If you would like to contribute to the site, pull requests are welcome!

If you don't know what a pull request is, that's okay too! Anyone can [open an issue](https://github.com/Boardgame-Design/boardgame-design.github.io/issues) on GitHub with an idea or suggestion.

(You may also want to create an "Issue" on GitHub before starting any major changes, to keep duplication of efforts to a minimum.)

Please feel free to [email Martin](mailto:website@boardgame.design) if you prefer.
