The twin cities area in Minnesota (MN) is home to many board game designers and publishers. This site's purpose is to be a resource for that local community.

There are generally three organizations that host boardgame design related events:

1. **[Split Perspective Studios](split_perspective_studios)** hosts "Design Days" roughly twice a month. The best way to hear about their events is via email, but you can also [join the Split Perspective Studios Discord](https://discord.gg/QS4hm3hfBs).
2. **[IGDA Twin Cities](http://igdatc.org)** hosts a playtesting event every month, and many other events. Go to their site for the link to join their Discord.
3. **[Break My Game](https://www.breakmygame.com/)** has a local in-person event on the first thursday of the month. Their Discord is not just for MN folks, and it is very active.

MN is also host to one or two Protospiel conferences per year.

At the moment there is not much here otherwise. If you are looking for information about board game design more generally, we recommend the excellently currated list of resources at [The Tabletop Game Designers Association](https://www.ttgda.org/resources).
