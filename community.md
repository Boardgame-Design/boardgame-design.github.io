# Community

When not meeting in person at a [local conference](local_conferences) or [design day](design_day), you can find local board game designers hanging out in several online venues.


## Split Perspective Studios Discord

This discord has been quite active, and hosts discussions about upcoming events, organizing playtests, industry opportunities, and just game design more generally.

You should be able to [join with this link](https://discord.gg/QS4hm3hfBs).


## IGDA Twin Cities Discord

The [IGDA Twin Cities chapter](https://igdatc.org) has a Discord that is fairly active, and hosts a number of channels for locally developed games (several of which are board games). If you do not want to maintain your own Discord instance you can request your own channel there.

They have a general `#tabletop` channel as well.


## MSP GameDev Slack

If you prefer Slack to Discord, the [MSPGameDev Slack](https://mspgamedev.slack.com/join/shared_invite/zt-4eeoc3mf-ygvIV_Rk~WxNtO6JquVVPw#/shared-invite/email) instance also has a `#board-games` channel.


## Any we missed?

If you would like your online community listed here (and it has a significant amount of game design discussion), please [get in touch](about/#how-to-help)!
